# Security Considerations and Best Practices

## Security Controls
1. **Encryption**
   - All S3 buckets use AES-256 encryption
   - SNS topics encrypted with KMS
   - CloudTrail logs encrypted at rest

2. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles follow least privilege principle
   - Resource policies restrict access
   - MFA required for administrative actions

3. **Monitoring**
   - CloudTrail enabled for all regions
   - AWS Config recording all resource changes
   - Security Hub standards enabled

## Compliance
1. **Standards Implemented**
   - CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
   - AWS Foundational Security Best Practices
   - PCI DSS where applicable

2. **Audit Requirements**
   - All API calls logged
   - Resource changes tracked
   - Security findings documented

## Incident Response
1. **Alert Levels**
   - CRITICAL: Immediate response required (SLA: 1 hour)
   - HIGH: Response required (SLA: 4 hours)
   - MEDIUM: Review required (SLA: 24 hours)
   - LOW: Routine review (SLA: 1 week)

2. **Response Procedures**
   - Alert verification
   - Impact assessment
   - Containment steps
   - Root cause analysis
